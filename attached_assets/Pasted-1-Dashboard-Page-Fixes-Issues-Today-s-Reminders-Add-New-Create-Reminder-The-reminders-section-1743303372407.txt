1. Dashboard Page Fixes
Issues:
* Today's Reminders & Add New/Create Reminder: The reminders section is not working correctly; buttons for "Add New" and "Create Reminder" are failing to function.
* Upcoming Appointments (Schedule & Schedule Appointment): This section is currently non-functional.
* Chatbot Error: When sending a message from the dashboard, the chatbot returns: Error Sending message 400: {“Invalid message date”, “errors”:[{“code”:”invalid_type”, “expected”:”date”, “received”:”string”, [“timestamp”], “message”:”Expected date, received string”}]}
Bug Fixes:
* Date Parsing: Ensure that all date fields (timestamps for messages, reminders, and appointments) are properly parsed into a date object (e.g., ISO format) before being sent to the backend.
* UI/Button Actions: Verify that event handlers for the "Add New" and "Create Reminder" buttons are correctly wired to trigger the appropriate API calls with valid payloads.
* Chatbot Integration: Audit the chatbot message function to convert string timestamps into valid date objects, ensuring the backend receives the proper data type.

2. Reminders Tab Fixes
Issues:
* Create New Reminder Button: When clicking “New Reminder”, the reminder does not log and returns: “Failed to Create reminder” 400: {“message” : “Invalid reminder date”, “errors”:[{“code”:”invalid_type”, “expected”:”date”, “received”:”string”, [“time”], “message”:”Expected date, received string”}]}
Bug Fixes:
* Date Validation & Conversion: Before sending reminder data to the API, convert the reminder date/time from string to a proper Date object (ISO 8601 format).
* Logging & UI Feedback: Improve error logging and display a user-friendly message that indicates the required date format if the conversion fails.

3. AI Companion Section Fixes
Issues:
* Starting New Conversations: The chatbot returns an error similar to the dashboard when initiating a new conversation: Error Sending message 400: {“Invalid message date”, “errors”:[{“code”:”invalid_type”, “expected”:”date”, “received”:”string”, [“timestamp”], “message”:”Expected date, received string”}]}
Bug Fixes:
* Timestamp Correction: Ensure that each new conversation and message includes a properly formatted timestamp (using the Date object) before sending to the backend.
* API Integration: Verify that the API endpoint for the chatbot is receiving correctly typed data, and add client-side validation to prevent misformatted dates.

4. Appointment Tab Fixes
Issues:
* TabsContent Usage: The appointment tab triggers an error: [plugin:runtime-error-plugin] `TabsContent` must be used within `Tabs`. Click outside, press Esc key, or fix the code to dismiss. You can also disable this overlay by setting server.hmr.overlay to false in vite.config.js.
Bug Fixes:
* Component Hierarchy: Wrap the TabsContent component properly within a Tabs parent component according to the UI framework guidelines.
* Vite HMR Settings: Optionally, update the Vite configuration (vite.config.js) to disable the HMR overlay if needed, though the primary fix should address the component structure.

5. Home Remedies Section Fixes
Issues:
* AI Suggestion Output: When searching for AI-suggested remedies, the output displays an API key error message: AI Suggested Remedies for "sore throat"
*     * API Key Required
*     * Ingredients:
*     * Valid OpenAI API key
*     * Instructions:
*     * Please provide a valid OpenAI API key to use this feature.
*     * Effectiveness:
Bug Fixes:
* API Key Configuration: Validate that the OpenAI API key is correctly set in the environment/configuration file and properly passed to the API call.
* Response Handling: Implement error handling for the remedy suggestion API to display a user-friendly message if the API key is missing or invalid, and log a clear error for debugging.

6. Health Tracker Section Enhancements
New Feature & Enhancements:
* Dummy Data Integration: Add a module that loads dummy data for demonstration purposes (including BP, heart rate, step count, and ECG measurements).
* Graphical Representation: Utilize libraries like Chart.js, D3.js, or Recharts to generate visually appealing, interactive graphs that display historical trends and daily readings.
* Data Interactivity: Enable hover effects and tooltips to display detailed data points when users interact with the graphs.

7. Scan Medicine Section Fixes
Issues:
* Scan Output Error: When scanning medicine, the results include placeholder text indicating missing API key: Scan Results
*     * Medicine Name
*     * API Key Required
*     * Dosage
*     * Please provide a valid OpenAI API key
*     * Purpose
*     * For demonstration purposes only
*     * Side Effects
*     * Cannot analyze medicine without API key
*     * Warnings
*     * API key missing or invalid
*     * Disclaimer: This information is provided for reference only...
Bug Fixes:
* API Key Verification: Confirm that the OpenAI or relevant medicine information API key is configured correctly and accessible by the scan feature.
* Output Formatting: Ensure the scan results are parsed correctly and display the actual medicine name, dosage, purpose, side effects, and warnings if the API key is valid.
* Fallback Messaging: If the API key is missing or invalid, display a clear, user-friendly error with instructions on how to configure the API key rather than placeholder text.

8. Reward and Token Section Fixes
Issues:
* Redeem Rewards Button: The button does not work, and there is no visual confirmation when rewards are redeemed.
Bug Fixes & Enhancements:
* Redeem Functionality: Verify the redeem rewards API endpoint integration, ensuring that tokens are properly deducted and the backend updates the user’s reward status.
* Animation & Visual Feedback: Implement an animation (e.g., a confetti burst or a progress bar animation) that triggers upon successful redemption.
* UI Enhancements: Redesign the Rewards and Tokens section with improved visual appeal, such as card layouts, animated counters, and clear progress indicators for earned tokens and milestones.

New Feature Additions
1. Dynamic Landing Page
* 3D Models: Integrate interactive 3D models using libraries like Three.js or Babylon.js to create an engaging, dynamic landing page.
* User Authentication: Include prominent Signup and Sign In buttons.
    * Sign In/Sign Up: Create separate pages with simple forms (email and password) and integrate Google Login.
    * Google Login Integration: Use OAuth2 for Google authentication. Ensure that upon successful login, the user’s name and profile details are fetched and displayed.
2. Light Mode/Dark Mode Toggle
* Toggle Button Implementation: Add a toggle button on both the Dashboard and Login pages to switch between light mode and dark mode.
* Theming Functionality: Implement CSS/SCSS themes or use a UI framework’s built-in theming options to switch styles dynamically.
    * Persistence: Store the user’s theme preference (e.g., in local storage) so that the setting persists across sessions.
